## The Magnificent Seven: A Proposal to Revolutionize Our Committee's Minimum Size

To Whom It May Concern (or to anyone who enjoys a bit of committee-themed humor),

In the grand tradition of making monumental changes that will echo through the hallowed halls of our organization's future, we propose a shift so audacious, so groundbreaking, that it will forever change the way we say, "Let's form a committee!" Yes, dear reader, we propose to change the minimum size of our committees from the duo dynamic of 2 to the magnificent, the unparalleled, the slightly more cumbersome but infinitely more entertaining number of 7.

Why, you ask? Let us delve into the reasons with the gravity and seriousness this proposal deserves:

Dramatic Entrances: Imagine the scene as our committee of seven strides into a room, the sound of their synchronized footsteps a testament to their unity and purpose. It's cinematic, it's majestic, itâ€™s...slightly impractical for scheduling meetings, but that's a small price to pay for such theatrics.

Diversity of Lunch Preferences: With two people, you're lucky if you can agree on pizza toppings. With seven, we can democratically decide between Italian, Mexican, Chinese, or that new fusion place no one understands but everyone wants to try. This isn't just a committee; it's a culinary adventure.

The Buddy System: Ever been in a committee and needed a buddy? With seven members, we introduce the revolutionary concept of the "Triple Buddy System," where no one is ever left without support during those intense moments of deciding whether to use Times New Roman or Arial in our reports.

More Birthday Parties: With seven members, the statistical likelihood of having a birthday party increases dramatically. This means more cake, more singing, and more opportunities to wear those little party hats that make every strategic planning session better.

Enhanced Decision-Making Through Rock, Paper, Scissors: With two people, decision-making can be a deadlock. With seven, we introduce the potential for a rock, paper, scissors tournament to solve any impasse. It's democratic, it's efficient, and it finally gives a legitimate reason for all those years of competitive rock, paper, scissors training.

Increased Email Volume: Let's face it, we all feel a bit lonely when our inbox is empty. With seven members, the number of "reply all" emails will skyrocket, ensuring that we always feel the warm glow of inclusion...or the mild irritation of an overflowing inbox. Tomato, tomahto.

The Spectacle of Scheduling: With two members, scheduling is a breeze. With seven, it becomes an epic saga filled with conflict, triumph, and the occasional cliffhanger. Will we find a meeting time that works for everyone? Tune in next week to find out!

In conclusion, by increasing our committee size from 2 to 7, we're not just adding members; we're adding drama, camaraderie, diversity, and a touch of logistical complexity that will surely make our meetings the highlight of everyone's calendar. Let us band together, not as a small group, but as a formidable assembly of seven, ready to tackle the challenges of our time with the seriousness and dedication that only a committee of this size can muster.

Yours in committee solidarity,
