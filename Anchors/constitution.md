# The Constitution of Cardano
## Preamble
We, the nodes and hodlers of Cardano, in Order to form a more perfect blockchain, establish consensus, ensure network tranquility, provide for the common defense (against double spends), promote the general welfare (tokens), and secure the Blessings of Ada to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Cardano Network.

### Article I: The Sovereighty of Stake
The Power of ADA: All governance power herein granted shall be derived from the staking of ADA, the true and unyielding currency of the realm. The more ADA you stake, the louder your voice, but with great power comes great responsibility.

The Council of Elders (a.k.a. Pool Operators): Those who run the nodes shall be known as the Council of Elders, guardians of the protocol, and shall have the power to propose changes, but they must never forget: With great uptime comes great responsibility.

### Article II: The Legislative Branch (a.k.a. The Proposal System)
The Proposal Assembly: Any ADA holder may propose changes to the network. However, proposals must be made in the spirit of improvement, not for turning the blockchain into a giant meme factory (unless it's a really good meme).

The Two-Thirds Joke Clause: Any proposal deemed too serious must be accompanied by a joke, to be reviewed by the Council of Humor, a body of ADA holders with a proven track record of dad jokes and puns.

### Article III: The Execution of Votes
Voting Rights: Every ADA counts as one vote, but in the spirit of fairness, votes will also be weighted by the creativity of the voter's wallet name.

The Voting Festival: Voting periods shall be known as Voting Festivals, where ADA holders celebrate democracy by casting their votes and engaging in virtual parties across the network.

### Article IV: Amendments and Forks
The Forking Clause: Should the community decide to fork, each new chain must be named with a pun on Cardano or ADA, ensuring that even in division, our humor remains united.

Amendment by Meme: Amendments to this Constitution can be proposed via meme, but only if the meme receives enough upvotes on the official Cardano meme board.

### Article V: The Final Clause
In ADA We Trust: All members of the Cardano community pledge to uphold the values of this Constitution, to not take ourselves too seriously, and to remember that at the end of the day, we're all just trying to make the world a better place, one block at a time.
